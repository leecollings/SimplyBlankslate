Simply Blankslate is the definitive WordPress boilerplate starter theme.
We've carefully constructed the most clean and minimalist theme possible for
designers and developers to use as a base to build websites for clients or to
build completely custom themes from scratch.

It's clean, simple, unstyled (intentionally), unformatted, and as white label as
possible, and most importantly, the CSS is reset for cross-browser-compatibility
and no intrusive visual CSS styles have been added whatsoever. A perfect
skeleton theme. For support and suggestions, go to: https://github.com/leecollings/simplyBlankslate/issues.

If you're creating your own theme or client project, open up all files and do a
"Find and Replace All in All Files" on the word "simplyblankslate" with your own
slug and prefix.
